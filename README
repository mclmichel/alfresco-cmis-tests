This project is simply a set of unit tests deisgned to run against an Alfresco > 3.3.x repository.
It was put together as a CMIS/OpenCmis learning exercise.

----Running the tests ----

By default it expects Alfresco running locally on port 8080 with the default admin/admin credentials.
With the Alfresco server running simply run

mvn clean test
