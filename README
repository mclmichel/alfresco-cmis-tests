This project is simply a set of unit tests deisgned to run against an Alfresco > 3.3.x repository.
It was put together as a CMIS/OpenCmis learning exercise.

Note: These tests both create content and then search for it. The eventual consistency offered by the solr indexing subsystem is not suitable for this kind of test.

Therefore ensure that you set lucene as the indexing subsystem before running these tests.  

To do this ensure theat the following property is set in alfresco-global.properties.

index.subsystem.name=lucene 

and not

index.subsystem.name=solr

----Running the tests ----

By default it expects Alfresco running locally on port 8080 with the default admin/admin credentials.
With the Alfresco server running. 

Dynamically deploy the custom model from src/test/resources/model/cmis-test-model.xml (Follow http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Dynamic_Models#Deploying_and_activating_a_custom_model)
Note: For the datetime tests to work follow the instructions for changing the lucene analyzer (http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/CMIS_Query_Language#Configuring_DateTime_resolution)

mvn clean test
